# How to ask questions?

We’d love to help you. Here are some tips (adapted from “how to ask” page in [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)):

## Search, and research

...and keep track of what you find. Even if you don't find a useful answer on Interact, including links to related questions that *haven't helped* can help others in understanding how your question is different from the rest. Do some searching and research of the errors you come across, it is likely that the first Google result will help you overcome the problem.

## Write a title that summarizes the specific problem

The title is the first thing potential TAs/students will see
*So make it count*:
- **Pretend you're talking to a busy TA/student** and have to sum up your entire question in one sentence: what details can you include that will help someone identify and solve your problem? Include any error messages, or unusual circumstances that make your question different from similar questions already on the site.
- **Spelling, grammar and punctuation are important!** Remember, this is the first part of your question others will see - you want to make a good impression. 
- If you're having trouble summarizing the problem, **write the title last** - sometimes writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem.

**Examples:**
> **Bad**: C Confusion
> **Good**: Why does using float instead of int give me different results when all of my inputs are integers?
> **Bad**: putty session doubt
> **Good**: How can I open a new Putty session while having another open?
> **Bad**: C if else problems
> **Good**: Why do we have to set the last element in a string to a null terminator?

## Introduce the problem before you post any code

In the body of your question, start by expanding on the summary you put in the title. Explain how you encountered the problem you're trying to solve, and any difficulties that have prevented you from solving it yourself. 

## Help others reproduce the problem

Not all questions benefit from including code, but if your problem is with code you've written, you should include some. But **don't just copy in your entire program**! It likely includes a lot of irrelevant details that readers will need to ignore when trying to reproduce the problem. Here are some guidelines:

- Include just enough code to allow others to reproduce the problem. For help with this, read [How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).
- If it is possible to create a live example of the problem that you can link to (for example, on http://sqlfiddle.com/ or http://jsbin.com/) then do so - but **also copy the code into the question itself**. Not everyone can access external sites, and the links may break over time. 
- **DO NOT post images of code, data, error messages, etc.** - copy or type the text into the question. Please reserve the use of images for diagrams or demonstrating rendering bugs, things that are impossible to describe accurately via text. 

## Post debugging information!
 
It is very important that we know what you did while solving the problem. That would not only let us know that you actually tried to solve the problem, but also help in eliminating some approaches, in turn saving everyone’s time. 
 
**Good debugging information might look like this:**
 
- I tried to put print statements on line 10 and line 12, and my line 12 print statement isn’t getting executed. That would lead me to believe something on my line 11 is incorrect. 
 
**Bad debugging information looks like this:**
 
- I TRIED TO DO EVERYTHING BUT THE CODE WON’T WORK. PLZ HELP!

## Proof-read before posting!

Now that you're ready to ask your question, take a deep breath and read through it from start to finish. Pretend you're seeing it for the first time: does it make sense? Try reproducing the problem yourself, in a fresh environment and make sure you can do so using only the information included in your question. Add any details you missed and read through it again. Now is a good time to make sure that your title still describes the problem!

## Post the question and respond to feedback

After you post, leave the question open in your browser for a bit, and see if anyone comments. If you missed an obvious piece of information, be ready to edit your question to include it. If someone posts an answer, be ready to try it out and provide feedback! If your question has been sufficiently answered, or you have solved your issue before receiving an answer, **please mark your post as resolved**. This way the course staff don't have to spend time trying to answer a question that no longer needs an answer.
